# Rails Secrets

This gem backports the `config/secrets.yml` from Rails 4.1 to Rails 4.0 applications.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rails-secrets'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rails-secrets

## Usage

Add this gem to your Gemfile, remove `config/initializers/secret_token.rb` and configure `config/secrets.yml` [as you would for Rails 4.1][1].
